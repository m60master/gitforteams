# Collaborating on BitBucket

**Overview of BitBucket**
BitBucket is a popular code hosting system by the same folks who built JIRA. I really like using BitBucket for projects where I'm collaborating with others, but need to hide my work. It offers a few free private repositories, which is perfect for the smaller independent projects that I work on from time to time.

**Creating an Account**
Signup for a BitBucket account.

**Importing a Repository**
Import the repository you created on GitLab (or download and upload the one that I created which you initially cloned from).

**Making Changes to Your Fork**
If you want to make changes to your fork, you need to clone the work locally, and the push the revisions back up to the server.

**Tracking Your Changes with Issues**
A review of how to create a ticket with an issue. Check to see if you can still convert an issue into a pull request.

**Accepting a Merge Request**
Overview of how to deal with an incoming pull request. (might need to break this into smaller segments)

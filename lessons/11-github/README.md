# Collaborating on GitHub

**Overview of GitHub**

GitHub is a popular code hosting system. Unlike GitLab, which we've been using, GitHub is a private company, it is not based on open source software. GitHub can definitely improve your experience with Git, but has several of its own GitHub “isms” which can make it difficult to know when you're working with Git terms, and when you're working with GitHub terms.

**Creating an Account**
Signup for a GitHub account.

**Forking a Repository**
Start by making a copy of the repository that I created. This is now your own playground to do whatever you want in. (Review of the GitLab procedure, except for GitHub.)

**Making Changes to Your Fork**
If you want to make changes to your fork, you need to clone the work locally, and the push the revisions back up to the server.

**Making Quicker Changes with the Web UI**
You can avoid making a local copy by using the Web UI to make simple changes to your repository. Generally it's harder to maintain good commit message quality through this method. (Linus refuses to accept commits submitted this way because of the poor formatting on messages.)

**Tracking Your Changes with Issues**
A review of how to create a ticket with an issue.

**Importing a New Repository**
Import the repository you created on GitLab (or download and upload the one that I created which you initially cloned from).

**Accepting a Pull Request**
Overview of how to deal with an incoming pull request. (might need to break this into smaller segments)

**Extending GitHub with Hub**
There is an additional set of command line tools available through the project Hub. I've used it to convert issues into Pull Requests (although I think that feature is now deprecated). Others have used it to create Pull Request builders (create a new EC2 instance for specific pull requests). If you use GitHub a lot, and are comfortable at the command line, you may find this project useful.

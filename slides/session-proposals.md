Title: Git for Teams of One or More 
Conference: LoneStarPHP

You've dabbled a little in version control using Git. You know about commits and pulls and branches. You may have even tried Git to rebase something once (and remember getting kinda freaked out by the headless thing). You can follow along with the various tutorials you've found online. But now you've been asked to implement a work flow strategy for your company's next project and you're not really sure how (or where) to start. In this session you will work closely with long-time version control lover Emma Jane Westby to create the perfect work flow strategy for each of your projects. This is a process talk about the pros and cons of different types of work flows. It is not a tutorial on how to run Git from the command line--once you know your work flow the commands will be much easier, and obvious. Promise.

Title: Git for Grown-ups
Conference: OSCON
Date: July 2014

You are a clever and talented person. You have architected a system that even my cat could use; your spreadsheet-fu is legendary. Your peers adore you. Your clients love you. But, until now, you haven’t *&#^! been able to make Git work. It makes you angry inside that you have to ask for help, again, to figure out that *&#^! command to upload your work.

It’s not you. It’s Git. Promise.

We’ll kick off this session with an explanation of why Git is so freaking hard to learn. Then we’ll flip the tables and make YOU (not Git) the centre of attention. You’ll learn how to define, and sketch out how version control works, using terms and scenarios that make sense to you. Yup, sketch. On paper. (Tablets and other electronic devices will be allowed, as long as you promise not to get distracted choosing the perfect shade for rage.) To this diagram you’ll layer on the common Git commands that are used regularly by efficient Git-using teams. It’ll be the ultimate cheat sheet, and specific to your job. If you think this sounds complicated, it’s not! Your fearless leader, Emma Jane, has been successfully teaching people how-to-tech for over a decade. She is well known for her non-technical metaphors which ease learners into complex, work-related topics that previously felt inaccessible.

Yes, this is an introductory session. No, you don’t have to have Git installed to attend. You don’t even need to know where the command line is on your computer. Yes, you should attend if you’ve been embarrassed to ask team-mates what Git command you used three weeks ago to upload your work…just in case you’re supposed to remember.

If you’re a super-human Git fanatic who is frustrated by people who don’t just “git it”, this session is also for you. You’ll learn new ways to effectively communicate your ever-loving Git, and you may develop a deeper understanding of why your previous attempts to explain Git have failed.

In this session you will work closely with long-time version control lover Emma Jane Westby to create the perfect work flow strategy for each of your projects. This is a process workshop designed to help you sort through the pros and cons of different types of work flows. It is not just a tutorial on how to run Git from the command line—it’s a workflow overhaul. Promise.

TUTORIAL REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTENDEES

- People with a very limited knowledge of Git will do better in this workshop.
- Technical project managers, developers transitioning to management positions, and developers looking to accept community contributions for their projects will get the most out of this session.
- To get the most out of this session you should bring your favorite diagramming tools (pencil and paper are perfect!).
- If you want to test out the commands, you should also bring a computer with Internet capabilities, and access to a remote repository, such as GitHub or BitBucket.
